🔍 Project Steps
1️⃣ Load Dataset in Python
Imported the dataset using pandas.
Verified file path, column types, missing values, and initial shape.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distribution of numerical and categorical features.
Visualized trends and patterns (bar charts, histograms, heatmaps).
Identified correlations, outliers, and behavioral insights.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handled missing values using mean/median/mode strategies.
Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistent data.
Converted data types (dates, categories, integers).
Created new derived features to support analysis.

4️⃣ SQL Analysis
Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.
Executed analytical SQL queries:
Customer segmentation
Top-selling categories
Monthly revenue trends
High-value customers (RFM logic optional)
Validated Python insights using SQL outputs.

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
Connected dataset to Power BI.
Designed interactive visuals:
Sales overview
Category-wise insights
Customer demographics
Monthly/Yearly trends
KPIs (Revenue, Orders, Avg Spend)
Added filters/slicers for better interactivity.

6️⃣ Report Creation
Summarized key findings:
Customer behavior insights
Top-performing categories
Sales drivers
Recommendations for business
Included supporting visuals and graphs.

7️⃣ Presentation (Gamma App)
Converted complete project into a clean, modern PPT-style presentation.
Added storytelling flow:
Problem → Approach → Insights → Recommendations

📈 Results & Key Insights
Identified top customer segments driving sales.
Found major purchasing patterns by age, gender, and category.
Highlighted revenue spikes and seasonal trends.
Suggested data-driven recommendations to improve performance.
